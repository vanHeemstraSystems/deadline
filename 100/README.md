# 100 - Introduction

[Deadlineâ„¢](http://deadline.thinkboxsoftware.com/?ref=blog.paperspace.com) is one of the most popular distributed rendering applications and is a must-know tool for anyone working in industries like animation, visual effects, and game development. With this tutorial, we will be looking at how to set up Deadline on Paperspace, specifically focusing on distributing renders across multiple render slaves. Because of the vast program support in Deadline, you can use this tutorial for a multitude of software, including Maya, 3ds max, Cinema 4D, After Effects, and Nuke to name a few. After reading this tutorial, you will be able to quickly set up your distributed cloud render farm and be rendering in no time.

**Note**: This tutorial will cover the basic setup. We will be reviewing Deadline VMX integration in a later tutorial.
