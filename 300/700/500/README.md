# 500 - Step 5 – Check the node’s functionality

Open up the Deadline Monitor from the Deadline Launcher.

Check for your nodes in the slaves list and make sure they are active.

**Note**: If you don't see your nodes or they are inactive, make sure you followed all the steps above. If you still don't see them, try restarting the machines and reconnecting to the repository. If they still don't show up, try [checking the documentation](http://docs.thinkboxsoftware.com/products/deadline/9.0/1_User%20Manual/index.html?ref=blog.paperspace.com#deadline-version-documentation) for any errors in installation.
