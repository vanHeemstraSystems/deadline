# 100 - Step 1 – Mounting your Shared Drive to a specific drive letter

This may seem obvious to some, but making sure that your shared drive is mounted to a consistent letter across all machines is extremely important for Deadline to be able to operate. For this example, we will mount our shared drive to the letter “Z:” on our first machine.

First access File explorer on your Paperspace machine, right-click on “This PC” and select “Map Network Drive”

Enter the share path to your drive provided by Paperspace and make sure that you check “Reconnect at sign-in” and “Connect using different credentials”. Note the drive letter that will be used, in this case “Z:”. **NOTE**: Make sure your Machine and your Private Network and your Shared Drive are all in the same Region (here: East Coast (NY2)).

In the pop-up log-in screen, enter the login credentials provided by Paperspace to connect to the shared drive and mount it. Make sure to check "Remember my credentials." **NOTE**: You can copy the username and password from the Paperspace page at https://console.paperspace.com/teu1osqtk/drives
