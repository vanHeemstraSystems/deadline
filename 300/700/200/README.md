# 200 - Step 2 – Setting up the Deadline repository on the shared drive

First, we need to make sure that our Deadline repository is set to our shared Drive. Go to the Deadline launcher app and in the bottom right corner, right-click on the deadline launcher app and select “Change Repository”.

The Repository path window should pop up. Make sure the path is pointing to the Shared Drive repository.

**Note**: If there is no repository on your shared drive, you can simply copy it from wherever it exists to your shared drive, and then set this Window’s path to the copied repository.
